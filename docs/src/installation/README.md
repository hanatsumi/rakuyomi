# Installation

Installing rakuyomi on your e-reader is a straightforward process that consists of two main steps:

1. **Choosing the Right Build**: First, you'll need to download the correct version of rakuyomi for your specific e-reader model and firmware version. Different devices require different builds to ensure compatibility.

2. **Installing to Your Device**: Once you have the correct build, you'll set up a basic configuration file and copy the necessary files to your e-reader. The process is similar across different devices, with only minor variations in folder locations.

Follow the chapters in this section to get rakuyomi up and running on your device. If you run into any issues, our community is here to help through the [issue tracker](https://github.com/hanatsumi/rakuyomi/issues).
