-- All symbols defined here are present in KOReader's NerdFonts distribution.
-- It's slightly old, so searching for icons in their cheatsheet won't work.
-- The easiest way to find icons is to either use free Font Awesome codepoints (which
-- are usually the same), or to explore all glyphs manually in the font file.
