## Installation

Download the latest release for your device from the [releases page](https://github.com/hanatsumi/rakuyomi/releases). Currently, only Kindle devices are supported (the Kindle build should work with Kobo devices, but it's untested).

Place the `rakuyomi.koplugin` folder inside KOReader's `plugins` folder.

## Configuration

In order to use the plugin, you'll need to add some sources. rakuyomi is compatible with [Aidoku](https://github.com/Aidoku/Aidoku) sources. The easiest way to obtain sources is to configure _source lists_ and download the sources through the app.

You'll most likely find links with the format `https://aidoku.app/add-source-list/?url=<source list URL>`. Grab the source list URL from these links and make sure it ends with `/index.min.json`. If it doesn't, add it yourself.

Create a `rakuyomi/settings.json` file inside KOReader's home directory, with the following contents:

```json
{
    "$schema": "https://github.com/hanatsumi/rakuyomi/releases/download/main/settings.schema.json",
    "source_lists": [
        "https://samplewebsite.com/sources/index.min.json",
        "<your source list URL>"
    ],
    "languages": ["en", "<your preferred language here>"]
}
```

After configuring a source list, sources can be installed through the plugin, by going to the main menu and going to "Manage sources".

For a better manga reading experience, you might also look into KOReader's [reader recommended settings](./docs/reader-recommended-settings/index.md).

## Usage

To open the library view, go to the "Search" menu and tap on the "Rakuyomi" entry. Tap the menu button on the top left to open the main menu.
